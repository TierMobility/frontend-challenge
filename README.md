# What you have to do

_‚ÄúAs a user I want to shorten my long url and be able to copy it into clipboard to post it on a social platform (e.g. Twitter).‚Äù_

## Challenge

In this challenge, we‚Äôre asking you to create a user interface to shorten URLs so,

If you are a **front end developer**,  please use the [Bitly API](https://dev.bitly.com/api-reference#operation/createBitlink) for the backend part.
To get a token you can follow these steps:

Go to your user settings

![Go to your user settings](./docs/profile.png)

Select API in the menu

After filling your user password you can request a token

In order to use the bitly API you need an `Authentication token`, which you will put in the environment variables (`.env`) of the project.

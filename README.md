# Frontend challenge ü¶Ö

## What you have to do
*‚ÄúAs a user I want to shorten my long url and be able to copy it into clipboard to post it on a social platform (e.g. Twitter).‚Äù*

In this challenge we‚Äôre asking you to create a user interface to shorten urls by using bitly API. 
In order to use the bitly API you need an `Authentication token`, which you will find in the environment variables (`.env`) of the project.

Bonus points: 

- `Validate user data`
- `Create a test suite`
- `Create and use reusable components`
- `Create your own CSS theme (clean & responsive layout)`

Please do not spend more than **2 hours** on this, don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt finish everything. Please send us a link to your project on GitHub. Good luck and have fun!

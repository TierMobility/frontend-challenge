# What you have to do 
*‚ÄúAs a user I want to shorten my long url and be able to copy it into clipboard to post it on a social platform (e.g. Twitter).‚Äù*

## Frontend challenge

In this challenge we‚Äôre asking you to create a user interface to shorten urls so, 

If you are a **full stack developer**, please, reuse the **shiny backend service** you created. 

If it‚Äôs not the case don‚Äôt feel bad and just use the [Bitly API](https://dev.bitly.com/api-reference#operation/createBitlink). 
In order to use the bitly API you need an `Authentication token`, which you will find in the environment variables (`.env`) of the project.

Bonus points: 

- `Validate user data`
- `Create a test suite`
- `Create and use reusable components`
- `Create your own CSS theme (clean & responsive layout)`

Please do not spend more than **2 hours** on this, don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt finish everything. Please send us a link to your project on GitHub. Good luck and have fun!


### Installation & setup

Run `yarn install` to install dependancies, then copy `.env.dist` to `.env`.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

## Backend challenge

*In this challenge we're asking you to spice up your life with your very own URL Shortener!*

We've all seen sites like [bit.ly](http://bit.ly/) that allow you to shorten a URL into something... well... shorter! It's time to you make your own.

There are roughly four parts to this challenge:

-  `Make a small API app that receives in a URL with a stack of your choice.`
-  `Using the supplied URL, generate a unique URL with the base of tier.app. It should be generated keeping uniqueness in mind.`
- `Return the shortened URL.`

Bonus points: 
 - `Track the visits in a second DB table for stats.`
 - `Have a high test coverage.`

It sounds more complex but breaking it down into these steps should help you tackle the problem more effectively. **Please do not spend more than 2 hours** on this, don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt finish everything.

Please send us a link to your project on GitHub.

Good luck and have fun!

# **Coding Challenge** ü¶Ö

# What you have to do

_‚ÄúAs a user I want to shorten my long url and be able to copy it into clipboard to post it on a social platform (e.g. Twitter).‚Äù_

## Challenge

In this challenge, we‚Äôre asking you to create a user interface to shorten URLs so,

If you are a **front end developer**,  please use the [Bitly API](https://dev.bitly.com/api-reference#operation/createBitlink) for the backend part.
In order to use the bitly API you need an `Authentication token`, which you will put in the environment variables (`.env`) of the project.

If you are a **full stack developer**, please tackle both backend and frontend part of the challenge, each of course only to the extent possible within the given time frame.

Bonus points:

-   `Validate user data`
-   `Create a test suite`
-   `Create and use reusable components`
-   `Create your own CSS theme (clean & responsive layout)`

Please do not spend more than **2 hours** on this, don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt finish everything. Please send us a link to your project on GitHub. Good luck and have fun!
